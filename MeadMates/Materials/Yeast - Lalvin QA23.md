-   Lalvin QA23 was selected in Portugal by the UTAD in cooperation with Viticultural Commission of Vinhos Verdes region. Lalvin QA23 has a very high -glucosidase activity, an enzyme which helps to cleave non-volatile aromatic compounds into their volatile state. Hence this yeast contributes to varietal / terroir fruit expression. Its use for Sauvignon Blanc is therefore highly recommended. Known for its reliability and robustness, QA23 tends to ferment well in clarified juice, low in nutrients.
