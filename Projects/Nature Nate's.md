# Equipment & Materials
[[Carboy - Fermtech]]
[[Carboy - North Mountain]]
[[Yeast - Lalvin QA23]]
[[Hydrometer]]
[[Auto Siphon - Fermtech]]
[[Funnel w Strainer]]
[[Star San]]
[[Potassium Metabisulfite]]
[[Potassium Sorbate]]
[[Go-Ferm]] 
[[Honey - Nature Nate's]] 
# Introduction, Purpose, Hypothesis

# Procedure
1. Prepare sanitizing solution per [[Sanitation]] in the kitchen sink.
2. Gather all materials needed for rehydrating the yeast and preparing the Must. 
	1. [[Carboy - Fermtech]]
	2. [[Funnel w Strainer]]
	3. [[Hydrometer]]
	4. Themometer for water
	5. small bowl to rehydrate yeast 
	6. [[Go-Ferm]]
	7. [[Star San]]
	8. [[Honey - Nature Nate's]]
	9. [[Yeast - Lalvin QA23]] 
	10. spoon for mixing
3. Fill a spray bottle with the sanitation solution
4. [[Yeast Rehydration with Nutrients]]
	1. yeast innoculation rate (0.2-0.4 g/L), per [[Yeast to Nutrient Ratio]], nutrient rate is between 0.25 - 0.5 g/L. 
	2. prepare 50mL of tap water at 35-37 C 
	3. add 1 packet of [[Yeast - Lalvin QA23]] 
		 A. 5 g yeast X 1.25 = 6.25 g nutrients
	4. add 6.25 g/gal of [[Go-Ferm]]
	5. stir and rehydrate for 20min
5. Prepare the Must:
	1. Dissolve honey in small amount of water (leave room to add additional water to reach batch volume).
	2. Add water to your batch volume minus volume for rehydration
	3. Aerate the must with a drill stirrer or shake/stir vigorously for 15 minutes.
6. Begin tempering yeast by adding 50mL must to the yeast slurry every 5 minutes.
7. When yeast slurry temperature is within 10 deg F of must temperature, pitch yeast into fermenter.
8. Record specific gravity, pH and temperature for future reference.
	1. Calculate what SG for 8%, 10%, and 14% ABV
9. Apply airlock. Ferment per [[TDS_Lalvin-QA23.pdf]] between 14 - 28 C in a dark room. 
10. Degas twice per day for first week of fermentation. Degas once per day for the second week. Degas every other day the third week. 
11. Record pH, SG, and temperature every at day 7, 10, and 14 days.
12. Stop fermenting when:
	1. SG remains constant for > 1 week, or
	2. Gas formation stops, or
	3. SG reached for desired ABV
13. Stabilize and Preserve:
	1. Rack into clean carboy 
	2. Add [[Potassium Sorbate]] & [[Potassium Metabisulfite]] 
		1. 1 tablet of [[Potassium Metabisulfite]] per gallon
		2.  1/2 teaspoon [[Potassium Sorbate]] per gallon
	3. Cold crash in fridge for >24hrs
	4. Bottle into clean wine bottles

# Observations, Calculations & Results

| Day       | pH  | SG    | Temperature |
| --------- | --- | ----- | ----------- |
| 0 (water) | 6   |       | 22          |
| 0 (must)  | 5   | 1.079 | 22.6            |


stop at SG 1.000 to get 10.4 ABV
