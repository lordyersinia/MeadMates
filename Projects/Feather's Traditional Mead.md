# Introduction, Purpose, Hypothesis
This traditional mead will use [[Yeast - Lalvin QA23|Lalvin QA23]] to ferment [[Honey - Glory Bee|Glory Bee Honey]] in a 1 gallon [[Carboy - Fermtech|Carboy]]. The yeast will be rehydrated with [[Go-Ferm]] nutrients before fermentation to ensure the must reaches the desired ABV (determined by SG reading ~ 1.100 with [[Hydrometer]]. I will aim for an ABV of 13%. This method will use 5lbs of honey which should be more than enough to reach the desired ABV with residual honey in the must. Two methods of stabilizing and preserving will be usesd after fermentation. [[Potassium Sorbate]] and [[Potassium Metabisulfite]] will be added to inhibit yeast activity. The yeast will be cold crashed out of solution, then racked in a separate [[Carboy - Fermtech|Carboy]] for aging. 

I expect fermentation to occur vigourosly and for longer due to the aditional nutrients added during rehydration. The excess honey should leave the mead sweat without having to back sweeten. I need to be careful not to let the ABV get too high since the yeast has a potential tollerance of 16% ABV. The [[Potassium Sorbate]] and [[Potassium Metabisulfite]] should ensure no additional fermentation. The cold crash will reduce SS when racking for aging. 
# Procedure
Day 1
	Gather Materials, Sanitation, Creating Must, Pitching Yeast. 
1. Prepare sanitizing solution per [[Sanitation]] in the kitchen sink.
2. Gather all materials needed for rehydrating the yeast and preparing the Must. 
	1. [[Carboy - Fermtech]]
	2. [[Funnel w Strainer]]
	3. [[Hydrometer]]
	4. Themometer for water
	5. small bowl to rehydrate yeast 
	6. [[Go-Ferm]]
	7. [[Star San]]
	8. [[Honey - Glory Bee]]
	9. [[Yeast - Lalvin QA23]] 
	10. spoon for mixing
3. Fill a spray bottle with the sanitation solution
4. [[Yeast Rehydration with Nutrients]]
	1. yeast innoculation rate (0.2-0.4 g/L), per [[Yeast to Nutrient Ratio]], nutrient rate is between 0.25 - 0.5 g/L. 
	2. prepare 50mL of tap water at 35-37 C 
	3. add 1 packet of [[Yeast - Lalvin QA23]] 
		1. 5 g yeast X 1.25 = 6.25 g nutrients
	4. add 6.25 g/gal of nutrients
	5. stir and rehydrate for 20min
5. Prepare the Must:
	1. Dissolve honey in small amount of water (leave room to add additional water to reach batch volume).
	2. Add water to your batch volume minus volume for rehydration
	3. Aerate the must with a drill stirrer or shake/stir vigorously for 15 minutes.
6. Begin tempering yeast by adding 63mL must to the yeast slurry every 5 minutes.
7. When yeast slurry temperature is within 10 deg F of must temperature, pitch yeast into fermenter.
8. Record specific gravity, pH and temperature for future reference.
	1. Calculate what SG for 8%, 10%, and 14% ABV
9. Apply airlock. Ferment per [[TDS_Lalvin-QA23.pdf]] between 14 - 28 C in a dark room. 
10. Degas twice per day for first week of fermentation. Degas once per day for the second week. Degas every other day the third week. 
11. Record pH, SG, and temperature every 2 days.
12. Stop fermenting when:
	1. SG remains constant for > 1 week
	2. Gas formation stops
	3. SG reached for desired ABV
13. Stabilize and Preserve:
	1. Rack into clean carboy 
	2. Add [[Potassium Sorbate]] & [[Potassium Metabisulfite]] 
		1. 1 tablet of [[Potassium Metabisulfite]] per gallon
		2.  1/2 teaspoon [[Potassium Sorbate]] per gallon
	3. Cold crash in fridge for >24hrs
	4. Bottle into clean wine bottles
