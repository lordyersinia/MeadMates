# Introduction, Purpose, Hypothesis
This traditional mead will use [[Yeast - Lalvin QA23|Lalvin QA23]] to ferment [[Honey - Glory Bee|Glory Bee Honey]] in a 1 gallon [[Carboy - Fermtech|Carboy]]. The yeast will be rehydrated with [[Go-Ferm]] nutrients before fermentation to ensure the must reaches the desired ABV (determined by SG reading ~ 1.100 with [[Hydrometer]]. I will aim for an ABV of 13%. This method will use 5lbs of honey which should be more than enough to reach the desired ABV with residual honey in the must. Two methods of stabilizing and preserving will be usesd after fermentation. [[Potassium Sorbate]] and [[Potassium Metabisulfite]] will be added to inhibit yeast activity. The yeast will be cold crashed out of solution, then racked in a separate [[Carboy - Fermtech|Carboy]] for aging. 

I expect fermentation to occur vigourosly and for longer due to the aditional nutrients added during rehydration. The excess honey should leave the mead sweat without having to back sweeten. I need to be careful not to let the ABV get too high since the yeast has a potential tollerance of 16% ABV. The [[Potassium Sorbate]] and [[Potassium Metabisulfite]] should ensure no additional fermentation. The cold crash will reduce SS when racking for aging. 
# Procedure
1. Prepare sanitizing solution per [[Sanitation]] in the kitchen sink.
2. Gather all materials needed for rehydrating the yeast and preparing the Must. 
	1. [[Carboy - Fermtech]]
	2. [[Funnel w Strainer]]
	3. [[Hydrometer]]
	4. Themometer for water
	5. small bowl to rehydrate yeast 
	6. [[Go-Ferm]]
	7. [[Star San]]
	8. [[Honey - Glory Bee]]
	9. [[Yeast - Lalvin QA23]] 
	10. spoon for mixing
3. Fill a spray bottle with the sanitation solution
4. [[Yeast Rehydration with Nutrients]]
	1. yeast innoculation rate (0.2-0.4 g/L), per [[Yeast to Nutrient Ratio]], nutrient rate is between 0.25 - 0.5 g/L. 
	2. prepare 50mL of tap water at 35-37 C 
	3. add 1 packet of [[Yeast - Lalvin QA23]] 
		 A. 5 g yeast X 1.25 = 6.25 g nutrients
	4. add 6.25 g/gal of [[Go-Ferm]]
	5. stir and rehydrate for 20min
5. Prepare the Must:
	1. Dissolve honey in small amount of water (leave room to add additional water to reach batch volume).
	2. Add water to your batch volume minus volume for rehydration
	3. Aerate the must with a drill stirrer or shake/stir vigorously for 15 minutes.
6. Begin tempering yeast by adding 50mL must to the yeast slurry every 5 minutes.
7. When yeast slurry temperature is within 10 deg F of must temperature, pitch yeast into fermenter.
8. Record specific gravity, pH and temperature for future reference.
	1. Calculate what SG for 8%, 10%, and 14% ABV
9. Apply airlock. Ferment per [[TDS_Lalvin-QA23.pdf]] between 14 - 28 C in a dark room. 
10. Degas twice per day for first week of fermentation. Degas once per day for the second week. Degas every other day the third week. 
11. Record pH, SG, and temperature every at day 7, 10, and 14 days.
12. Stop fermenting when:
	1. SG remains constant for > 1 week, or
	2. Gas formation stops, or
	3. SG reached for desired ABV
13. Stabilize and Preserve:
	1. Rack into clean carboy 
	2. Add [[Potassium Sorbate]] & [[Potassium Metabisulfite]] 
		1. 1 tablet of [[Potassium Metabisulfite]] per gallon
		2.  1/2 teaspoon [[Potassium Sorbate]] per gallon
	3. Cold crash in fridge for >24hrs
	4. Bottle into clean wine bottles

# Observations, Calculations & Results

| Day | pH  | SG  | Temperature |
| --- | --- | --- | ----------- |
| 0   | 4   | 1.1 | 22          |
| 7   | 3    |1.024|   20.7 |
| 10  |  3   | 1.008|       20.1 |
| 14  |     |     |             |

## Day 0
Went to the lab to weigh nutrients. 6.2486g Used 11.8ml [[Star San]] solution used to 2 gallons of tap water to make sanitation solution. Sterilized hydrometer, airlocks, carboys, and funnel. Filled a spray bottle with sanitation solution for later use. Place the honey in a warm water bath before making the Must. Rinsed carboy of suds from sanitation solution with 900mL Spring water. Used funnel to trasnfer honey to carboy. 

SP was way too high. Diluting down with water. 

[[ChatGPT calculation of dilution]] 
	final dilution is approximately 23.55561%.
	Therefore, the final concentration of honey in grams per liter is approximately 329.78 g/L  or 2.748 lb/gal (US)

I got 1.1. I will ferment to 0.98 to get 15.9% ABV. 
	2/3 honey 1.06 SG 5.3% ABV
	1/3 honey 1.02 SG 10.6% ABV

pH of must was 4

used ~ 100mL of water to disolve the nutrients before adding the yeast. started rehydration with 37 C water for 20min. Mixed intermitently through the 20min duration. Added some of the must to the rehydration container. I poured the yeast into the must when the temp of the yeast was at 25.7 C. The temp of the must was 22 C. 

19:04 fermentation start

## Day 1
Checked the carboy in the morning before work and there were bubbles passing through the air lock at a rate of ~ 1 bubble per 3 seconds. At lunch I removed the air lock and degassed the carboy for no more than 10min. A good amount of gas was released and nothing spilled over. Gas seemes to be steadily released from the air lock. The color of the must had become more turbid. The second degas of the day released more than the first. 

I feel like that was a lot of gas released so I will do a SG reading tomorrow. 

## Day 2
Degassed at 12:13 until there was no more pressure after shaking. The amount of gas released felt about the same as yesterday. I will wait to take another SG reading until Day 7. Per [[TDS_GoFerm.pdf]] i think we passed the peak CO2 production. Should expect less CO2 when degassing tomorrow. Second degass at 22:43. 

## Day 3
Degassed at lunch 12:21. No significant changes. I feel like there was less CO2 produced this time. It is starting to smell more acidic. Second degass today at 23:25

## Day 4
12:30 degassed at lunch. I have noticed a small white biomass as I shake the container. I will monitor it. If it gets big enough I will attempt to remove it from the carboy. 23:12 degassed. The smell is getting more like wine.

## Day 5
12:32 degassed at lunch. The white biomass is getting more distinct. It is no larger than a dime at the moment. Forgot to degass at night. 

## Day 6
I will begin degassing once a day. Partly due to time constraints. 17:17 degassed.

## Day 7
Degassed at 22:40 
SG 1.024      ~ 10.1% ABV
This is the 1/3 sugar level, so much longer after this point will produce a more dry mead. 
pH 3
Temp  20.7 C
I did a taste test and it is drinkable! I think I should let it ferment a few more days, then I will start to stablize and preserve the Mead. 

## Day 8
Let rest today.

## Day 9 
Gentle swirling to release gas 20:42

## Day 10
Mix and take another reading of SG. 
SG 1.008   ~12.2% ABV
pH 3
Began Stabilization with 1 Campden Tablet and half a teaspoon of potassium sorbate to the carboy. Mixed, then placed in the fridge to cold crash. 18:57

## Day 11
No bubbles noticed from the air lock. About 1.5 cm of sediment at the bottom of the carboy. Not shaken/stirred today. I have ordered corks, a corker and another carboy for racking.

## Day 14
1.8 cm of sediment. The mead is clearing up more than the days before. 

## Day 16
HEAD
Sanitize carboy for racking, siphon, funnel with filter, 4 wine bottles and refill the spray bottle. 

Take a SG after racking, taste and decide on adding more honey. 
	if added more honey, take another SG
