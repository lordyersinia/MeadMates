# Introduction, Purpose, Hypothesis
This traditional mead will use [[Yeast - Lalvin QA23|Lalvin QA23]] to ferment [[Honey - Glory Bee|Glory Bee Honey]] in a 1 gallon [[Carboy - Fermtech|Carboy]]. The yeast will be rehydrated with [[Go-Ferm]] nutrients before fermentation to ensure the must reaches the desired ABV (determined by SG reading ~ 1.100 with [[Hydrometer]]. I will aim for an ABV of 13%. This method will use 5lbs of honey which should be more than enough to reach the desired ABV with residual honey in the must. Two methods of stabilizing and preserving will be usesd after fermentation. [[Potassium Sorbate]] and [[Potassium Metabisulfite]] will be added to inhibit yeast activity. The yeast will be cold crashed out of solution, then racked in a separate [[Carboy - Fermtech|Carboy]] for aging. 

I expect fermentation to occur vigourosly and for longer due to the aditional nutrients added during rehydration. The excess honey should leave the mead sweat without having to back sweeten. I need to be careful not to let the ABV get too high since the yeast has a potential tollerance of 16% ABV. The [[Potassium Sorbate]] and [[Potassium Metabisulfite]] should ensure no additional fermentation. The cold crash will reduce SS when racking for aging.
