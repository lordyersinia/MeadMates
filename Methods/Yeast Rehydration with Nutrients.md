DOSAGE RATE: 1 x 5g sachet for 4.5 – 23L 

1. Rehydrate the yeast in 50ml of water, at a temperature between 35-37°C (95-98.6°F). 
2. Prepare Nutrients:
	1. Recommended dosage: is 30 g/hL (2.4lb/1000gal) of must volume (when a 25 g/hL (2lb/1000gal) active dry yeast dose rate is employed). 
	2. If using a higher or lower dose rate of yeast, respect a ratio of 1 part yeast: 1.25 parts Go-Ferm®.
3. Dissolve by gently stirring and wait for 20 minutes. 
4. Add the must. The difference in temperature between the must to be inoculated and the rehydration medium should not be higher than 10°C (if necessary, acclimatize the temperature of the medium by slowly adding must). 
5. The total rehydration time should not exceed 45 minutes. 
6. It is crucial that a clean container is used to rehydrate the yeast. 
7. Rehydration in must is not recommended
