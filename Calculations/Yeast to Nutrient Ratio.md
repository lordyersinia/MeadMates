Recommended dosage: is 30 g/hL (2.4lb/1000gal) of must volume (when a 25 g/hL (2lb/1000gal) active dry yeast dose rate is employed). 

If using a higher or lower dose rate of yeast, respect a ratio of 1 part yeast: 1.25 parts Go-FermÂ®.

1 g/hL = 0.01 g/L
1 g/L = 3.79 g/gal


if yeast ratio is:

	25 g/hL = .25 g/L  (0.9475 g/gal)

then nutrient ratio is:

	30 g/hL = .30 g/L  (1.137 g/gal)
